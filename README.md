# Student Degree Recommendation System

## Abstract
Recommendation systems are at the forefront of many business applications, e-commerce, and
digital software. Relevant research involves creating various types of recommendation systems
including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods that appear to be
the most effective recommendation system approaches. With the growing popularity of machine
learning, the objective of this thesis is to create a viable student degree recommendation system
that predicts and recommends student specializations or majors based on input data. The proposed
pipeline includes data exploration, which analyzes the underlying nature of the data. Following exploration is the preprocessing stage, which investigates missing values, outlier detection,
and feature selection techniques to clean the dataset. Hyperparameter optimization is executed to
maximize model performances. The proposed model is a Random Forest model alongside other
supervised classifiers including Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
Results indicate that Random Forest outperformed all other classifiers with consistent accuracies
above 0.7, ahead of soft voting classifiers in a synthetically generated dataset, as well as the student dataset with specialization and major as the label variables in independent iterations. For
interpretability, Random Forest provided the simplest explanations regarding feature interactions
with the target variable including feature importance, Shapley values, and partial dependence plots.
Biology, credit hours completed, and the school type were among the most numerically influential
features when analyzing the impact on confidence of prediction.
